# Diff datasets

The contents of this repository are based on the [IterativeJavaMatcher/IJM_Reproductionset](https://github.com/IterativeJavaMatcher/IJM_Reproductionset) repository, with each testcase in the `expert` dataset converted into a separate Git commit. This allows the testcases to be inspected using common code review software, such as the commit viewer built into GitHub.
